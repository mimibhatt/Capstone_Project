# Predicting credit risk using Machine Learning
This is my final project for the 6 months certification course in AI/ ML from UC Berkeley
In this project I am using various classification models to predict if there is a risk of default with a credit. 
Jupiter notebook with code, experimentation, implementation is located [here]

# Business Goals
Every loan lending company needs to assess if the borrower will default to pay the loan or will be able to pay on time. This exercise is to predict if a borrower will default using some of the classification machine learning models. Predicting accurately will help to reduce the loss from lending loans to borrowers who default.

# Data
The data set used is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bytadit/bank-loan-dataset-2014-2017) It contains lending information for borrowers of different credit plans and whether the borrower paid or defaulted. The original data set has 466285 rows and 75 columns.

# Modeling and Performance
I used Logistic Regression for Baseline
